# TestGen Tool - Comprehensive Test Generation

**Generates thorough test suites with edge case coverage through workflow-driven investigation**

The `testgen` tool creates comprehensive test suites by analyzing your code paths, understanding intricate dependencies, and identifying realistic edge cases and failure scenarios that need test coverage. This workflow tool guides Claude through systematic investigation of code functionality, critical paths, edge cases, and integration points across multiple steps before generating comprehensive tests with realistic failure mode analysis.

## Thinking Mode

**Default is `medium` (8,192 tokens) for extended thinking models.** Use `high` for complex systems with many interactions or `max` for critical systems requiring exhaustive test coverage.

## How the Workflow Works

The testgen tool implements a **structured workflow** for comprehensive test generation:

**Investigation Phase (Claude-Led):**
1. **Step 1**: Claude describes the test generation plan and begins analyzing code functionality
2. **Step 2+**: Claude examines critical paths, edge cases, error handling, and integration points
3. **Throughout**: Claude tracks findings, test scenarios, and coverage gaps
4. **Completion**: Once investigation is thorough, Claude signals completion

**Test Generation Phase:**
After Claude completes the investigation:
- Complete test scenario catalog with all edge cases
- Framework-specific test generation
- Realistic failure mode coverage
- Final test suite with comprehensive coverage

This workflow ensures methodical analysis before test generation, resulting in more thorough and valuable test suites.

## Model Recommendation

Test generation excels with extended reasoning models like Gemini Pro or O3, which can analyze complex code paths, understand intricate dependencies, and identify comprehensive edge cases. The combination of large context windows and advanced reasoning enables generation of thorough test suites that cover realistic failure scenarios and integration points that shorter-context models might overlook.

## Example Prompts

**Basic Usage:**
```
"Use zen to generate tests for User.login() method"
"Generate comprehensive tests for the sorting method in src/new_sort.py using o3"
"Create tests for edge cases not already covered in our tests using gemini pro"
```

## Key Features

- **Multi-agent workflow** analyzing code paths and identifying realistic failure modes
- **Generates framework-specific tests** following project conventions
- **Supports test pattern following** when examples are provided
- **Dynamic token allocation** (25% for test examples, 75% for main code)
- **Prioritizes smallest test files** for pattern detection
- **Can reference existing test files**: `"Generate tests following patterns from tests/unit/"`
- **Specific code coverage** - target specific functions/classes rather than testing everything
- **Image support**: Test UI components, analyze visual requirements: `"Generate tests for this login form using the UI mockup screenshot"`
- **Edge case identification**: Systematic discovery of boundary conditions and error states
- **Realistic failure mode analysis**: Understanding what can actually go wrong in production
- **Integration test support**: Tests that cover component interactions and system boundaries

## Test Generation Strategy

**Code Path Analysis:**
- Identifies all execution paths through the code
- Maps conditional branches and loops
- Discovers error handling paths
- Analyzes state transitions

**Edge Case Discovery:**
- Boundary value analysis (empty, null, max values)
- Invalid input scenarios
- Race conditions and timing issues
- Resource exhaustion cases

**Failure Mode Analysis:**

- Data corruption scenarios

**Framework Detection:**
The tool automatically detects and generates tests for:
- **Python**: pytest, unittest, nose2
- **JavaScript**: Jest, Mocha, Jasmine, Vitest
- **Java**: JUnit 4/5, TestNG, Mockito

- **Swift**: XCTest
- **Go**: testing package
- **And more**: Adapts to project conventions

## Test Categories Generated
