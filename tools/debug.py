Debug tool - Systematic root cause analysis and debugging assistance

This tool provides a structured workflow for investigating complex bugs and issues.
It guides you through systematic investigation steps with forced pauses between each step
to ensure thorough code examination before proceeding. The tool supports backtracking,
hypothesis evolution, and expert analysis integration for comprehensive debugging.

Key features:
- Step-by-step investigation workflow with progress tracking
- Context-aware file embedding (references during investigation, full content for analysis)
- Automatic conversation threading and history preservation
- Expert analysis integration with external models
- Support for visual debugging with image context
- Confidence-based workflow optimization

        "could cause instability. In concurrent systems, watch for race conditions, shared state, or timing "
