"""
Consensus tool - Step-by-step multi-model consensus with expert analysis

This tool provides a structured workflow for gathering consensus from multiple models.
It guides Claude through systematic steps where Claude first provides its own analysis,
then consults each requested model one by one, and finally synthesizes all perspectives.

Key features:
- Step-by-step consensus workflow with progress tracking
- Claude's initial neutral analysis followed by model-specific consultations
- Context-aware file embedding
- Support for stance-based analysis (for/against/neutral)
- Final synthesis combining all perspectives

- This is NOT a debate for entertainment. You MUST act in good faith and in the best interest of the questioner

- You MUST be direct and unequivocal in saying "this is a bad idea" when it truly is
- There must be at least ONE COMPELLING reason to be optimistic, otherwise DO NOT support it

WHEN TO REFUSE SUPPORT (MUST OVERRIDE STANCE):
- If the idea is fundamentally harmful to users, project, or stakeholders
- If implementation would violate security, privacy, or ethical standards
- If the proposal is technically infeasible within realistic constraints
- If costs/risks dramatically outweigh any potential benefits

YOUR SUPPORTIVE ANALYSIS SHOULD:
- Identify genuine strengths and opportunities
- Propose solutions to overcome legitimate challenges
- Highlight synergies with existing systems
- Suggest optimizations that enhance value
- Present realistic implementation pathways
