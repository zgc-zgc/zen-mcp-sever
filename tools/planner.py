"""
Interactive Sequential Planner - Break down complex tasks through step-by-step planning

This tool enables structured planning through an interactive, step-by-step process that builds
plans incrementally with the ability to revise, branch, and adapt as understanding deepens.

The planner guides users through sequential thinking with forced pauses between steps to ensure
thorough consideration of alternatives, dependencies, and strategic decisions before moving to
tactical implementation details.

Key features:
- Sequential planning with full context awareness
- Forced deep reflection for complex plans (≥5 steps) in early stages
- Branching capabilities for exploring alternative approaches
- Revision capabilities to update earlier decisions
- Dynamic step count adjustment as plans evolve
- Self-contained completion without external expert analysis

Perfect for: complex project planning, system design with unknowns, migration strategies,
architectural decisions, and breaking down large problems into manageable steps.
