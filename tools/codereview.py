Code Review tool - Comprehensive code analysis and review

This tool provides professional-grade code review capabilities using
Gemini's understanding of code patterns, best practices, and common issues.
It can analyze individual files or entire codebases, providing actionable
feedback categorized by severity.

Key Features:
- Multi-file and directory support
- Configurable review types (full, security, performance, quick)
- Severity-based issue filtering
- Custom focus areas and coding standards
- Structured output with specific remediation steps

**Claude's Next Steps:**

1. **Understand the Context**: First examine the specific functions, files, and code sections mentioned in the review to understand each issue thoroughly.

2. **Present Options to User**: After understanding the issues, ask the user which specific improvements they would like to implement, presenting them as a clear list of options.

3. **Implement Selected Fixes**: Only implement the fixes the user chooses, ensuring each change is made correctly and maintains code quality.

Remember: Always understand the code context before suggesting fixes, and let the user decide which improvements to implement."""
