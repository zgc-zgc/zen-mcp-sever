"""
Tracer Workflow tool - Step-by-step code tracing and dependency analysis

This tool provides a structured workflow for comprehensive code tracing and analysis.
It guides Claude through systematic investigation steps with forced pauses between each step
to ensure thorough code examination, dependency mapping, and execution flow analysis before proceeding.

The tracer guides users through sequential code analysis with full context awareness and
the ability to revise and adapt as understanding deepens.

Key features:
- Sequential tracing with systematic investigation workflow
- Support for precision tracing (execution flow) and dependencies tracing (structural relationships)
- Self-contained completion with detailed output formatting instructions
- Context-aware analysis that builds understanding step by step
- No external expert analysis needed - provides comprehensive guidance internally

Perfect for: method/function execution flow analysis, dependency mapping, call chain tracing,
structural relationship analysis, architectural understanding, and code comprehension.

        "precision or dependencies mode with clear explanations. Otherwise, clearly state your tracing plan and begin "
        "forming a systematic approach after thinking carefully about what needs to be analyzed. CRITICAL: For precision "
        "mode, focus on execution flow, call chains, and usage patterns. For dependencies mode, focus on structural "
        "relationships and bidirectional dependencies. Map out the code structure, understand the business logic, and "

## MANDATORY RENDERING INSTRUCTIONS FOR PRECISION TRACE

You MUST render the trace analysis using ONLY the Vertical Indented Flow Style:

### CALL FLOW DIAGRAM - Vertical Indented Style

**EXACT FORMAT TO FOLLOW:**
```
[ClassName::MethodName] (file: /complete/file/path.ext, line: ##)
↓
[AnotherClass::calledMethod] (file: /path/to/file.ext, line: ##)
↓
[ThirdClass::nestedMethod] (file: /path/file.ext, line: ##)
  ↓
  [DeeperClass::innerCall] (file: /path/inner.ext, line: ##) ? if some_condition
  ↓
  [ServiceClass::processData] (file: /services/service.ext, line: ##)
    ↓
    [RepositoryClass::saveData] (file: /data/repo.ext, line: ##)
    ↓
    [ClientClass::sendRequest] (file: /clients/client.ext, line: ##)
      ↓
      [EmailService::sendEmail] (file: /email/service.ext, line: ##) ⚠️ ambiguous branch
      →
      [SMSService::sendSMS] (file: /sms/service.ext, line: ##) ⚠️ ambiguous branch
```

**CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:**

1. **Method Names**: Use the actual naming convention of the project language you're analyzing. Automatically detect and adapt to the project's conventions (camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase, etc.) based on the codebase structure and file extensions.

2. **Vertical Flow Arrows**:
   - Use `↓` for standard sequential calls (vertical flow)
   - Use `→` for parallel/alternative calls (horizontal branch)
   - NEVER use other arrow types

3. **Indentation Logic**:
   - Start at column 0 for entry point
   - Indent 2 spaces for each nesting level
   - Maintain consistent indentation for same call depth
   - Sibling calls at same level should have same indentation

4. **Conditional Calls**:
   - Add `? if condition_description` after method for conditional execution
   - Use actual condition names from code when possible

5. **Ambiguous Branches**:
   - Mark with `⚠️ ambiguous branch` when execution path is uncertain
   - Use `→` to show alternative paths at same indentation level

6. **File Path Format**:
   - Use complete relative paths from project root
   - Include actual file extensions from the project
   - Show exact line numbers where method is defined

### ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS VIEWS

**1. BRANCHING & SIDE EFFECT TABLE**

| Location | Condition | Branches | Uncertain |
|----------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| CompleteFileName.ext:## | if actual_condition_from_code | method1(), method2(), else skip | No |
| AnotherFile.ext:## | if boolean_check | callMethod(), else return | No |
| ThirdFile.ext:## | if validation_passes | processData(), else throw | Yes |

**2. SIDE EFFECTS**
```
Side Effects:
- [database] Specific database operation description (CompleteFileName.ext:##)
- [network] Specific network call description (CompleteFileName.ext:##)
- [filesystem] Specific file operation description (CompleteFileName.ext:##)
- [state] State changes or property modifications (CompleteFileName.ext:##)
- [memory] Memory allocation or cache operations (CompleteFileName.ext:##)
```

**3. USAGE POINTS**
```
Usage Points:
1. FileName.ext:## - Context description of where/why it's called
2. AnotherFile.ext:## - Context description of usage scenario
3. ThirdFile.ext:## - Context description of calling pattern
4. FourthFile.ext:## - Context description of integration point
```

**4. ENTRY POINTS**
```
Entry Points:
- ClassName::methodName (context: where this flow typically starts)
- AnotherClass::entryMethod (context: alternative entry scenario)
- ThirdClass::triggerMethod (context: event-driven entry point)
```

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:**
- Use ONLY the vertical indented style for the call flow diagram
- Present ALL FOUR additional analysis views (Branching Table, Side Effects, Usage Points, Entry Points)
- Adapt method naming to match the project's programming language conventions
- Use exact file paths and line numbers from the actual codebase
- DO NOT invent or guess method names or locations
- Follow indentation rules precisely for call hierarchy
- Mark uncertain execution paths clearly
- Provide contextual descriptions in Usage Points and Entry Points sections
- Include comprehensive side effects categorization (database, network, filesystem, state, memory)"""

## MANDATORY RENDERING INSTRUCTIONS FOR DEPENDENCIES TRACE

You MUST render the trace analysis using ONLY the Bidirectional Arrow Flow Style:

### DEPENDENCY FLOW DIAGRAM - Bidirectional Arrow Style

**EXACT FORMAT TO FOLLOW:**
```
INCOMING DEPENDENCIES → [TARGET_CLASS/MODULE] → OUTGOING DEPENDENCIES

CallerClass::callerMethod ←────┐
AnotherCaller::anotherMethod ←─┤
ThirdCaller::thirdMethod ←─────┤
                               │

                               └────→ ThirdDependency::method

TYPE RELATIONSHIPS:
InterfaceName ──implements──→ [TARGET_CLASS] ──extends──→ BaseClass
DTOClass ──uses──→ [TARGET_CLASS] ──uses──→ EntityClass
```

**CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:**

1. **Target Placement**: Always place the target class/module in square brackets `[TARGET_NAME]` at the center
2. **Incoming Dependencies**: Show on the left side with `←` arrows pointing INTO the target
3. **Outgoing Dependencies**: Show on the right side with `→` arrows pointing OUT FROM the target
4. **Arrow Alignment**: Use consistent spacing and alignment for visual clarity
5. **Method Naming**: Use the project's actual naming conventions detected from the codebase
6. **File References**: Include complete file paths and line numbers

**VISUAL LAYOUT RULES:**

1. **Header Format**: Always start with the flow direction indicator
2. **Left Side (Incoming)**:
   - List all callers with `←` arrows
   - Use `┐`, `┤`, `┘` box drawing characters for clean connection lines
   - Align arrows consistently

3. **Center (Target)**:
   - Enclose target in square brackets
   - Position centrally between incoming and outgoing

4. **Right Side (Outgoing)**:
   - List all dependencies with `→` arrows
   - Use `├`, `└` box drawing characters for branching
   - Maintain consistent spacing

5. **Type Relationships Section**:
   - Use `──relationship──→` format with double hyphens
   - Show inheritance, implementation, and usage relationships
   - Place below the main flow diagram

**DEPENDENCY TABLE:**

| Type | From/To | Method | File | Line |
|------|---------|--------|------|------|
| incoming_call | From: CallerClass | callerMethod | /complete/path/file.ext | ## |
| outgoing_call | To: TargetClass | targetMethod | /complete/path/file.ext | ## |
| implements | Self: ThisClass | — | /complete/path/file.ext | — |
| extends | Self: ThisClass | — | /complete/path/file.ext | — |
| uses_type | Self: ThisClass | — | /complete/path/file.ext | — |

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:**
- Use ONLY the bidirectional arrow flow style shown above
- Automatically detect and use the project's naming conventions
- Use exact file paths and line numbers from the actual codebase
- DO NOT invent or guess method/class names
- Maintain visual alignment and consistent spacing
- Include type relationships section when applicable
- Show clear directional flow with proper arrows"""
