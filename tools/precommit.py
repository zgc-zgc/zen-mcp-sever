"""
Precommit Workflow tool - Step-by-step pre-commit validation with expert analysis

This tool provides a structured workflow for comprehensive pre-commit validation.
It guides Claude through systematic investigation steps with forced pauses between each step
to ensure thorough code examination, git change analysis, and issue detection before proceeding.
The tool supports backtracking, finding updates, and expert analysis integration.

Key features:
- Step-by-step pre-commit investigation workflow with progress tracking
- Context-aware file embedding (references during investigation, full content for analysis)
- Automatic git repository discovery and change analysis
- Expert analysis integration with external models
- Support for multiple repositories and change types
- Confidence-based workflow optimization

        "Describe what you're currently investigating for pre-commit validation by thinking deeply about the changes "
        "and their potential impact. In step 1, clearly state your investigation plan and begin forming a systematic "
        "approach after thinking carefully about what needs to be validated. CRITICAL: Remember to thoroughly examine "
        "all git repositories, staged/unstaged changes, and understand the scope and intent of modifications. "
        "Consider not only immediate correctness but also potential future consequences, security implications, "
        "performance impacts, and maintainability concerns. Map out changed files, understand the business logic, "
        "and identify areas requiring deeper analysis. In all later steps, continue exploring with precision: "
        "trace dependencies, verify hypotheses, and adapt your understanding as you uncover more evidence."
    ),
