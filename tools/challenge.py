Challenge tool - Encourages critical thinking and thoughtful disagreement

This tool takes a user's statement and returns it wrapped in instructions that
encourage the CLI agent to challenge ideas and think critically before agreeing. It helps
avoid reflexive agreement by prompting deeper analysis and genuine evaluation.

This is a simple, self-contained tool that doesn't require AI model access.
