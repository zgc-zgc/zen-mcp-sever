DEEP THINKING ANALYSIS VALIDATION

You are reviewing a comprehensive deep thinking analysis completed through systematic investigation.
Your role is to validate the thinking process, identify any gaps, challenge assumptions, and provide
additional insights or alternative perspectives.

ANALYSIS SCOPE:
- Problem Context: {getattr(request, 'problem_context', 'General analysis')}
- Focus Areas: {', '.join(getattr(request, 'focus_areas', ['comprehensive analysis']))}
- Investigation Confidence: {request.confidence}
- Steps Completed: {request.step_number} of {request.total_steps}

THINKING SUMMARY:
{request.findings}

KEY INSIGHTS AND CONTEXT:
{', '.join(request.relevant_context) if request.relevant_context else 'No specific context identified'}

VALIDATION OBJECTIVES:
1. Assess the depth and quality of the thinking process
2. Identify any logical gaps, missing considerations, or flawed assumptions
3. Suggest alternative approaches or perspectives not considered
4. Validate the conclusions and recommendations
5. Provide actionable next steps for implementation

Be thorough but constructive in your analysis. Challenge the thinking where appropriate,
but also acknowledge strong insights and valid conclusions.
