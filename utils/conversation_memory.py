Conversation Memory for AI-to-AI Multi-turn Discussions

This module provides conversation persistence and context reconstruction for
stateless MCP (Model Context Protocol) environments. It enables multi-turn
conversations between Claude and Gemini by storing conversation state in memory
across independent request cycles.

CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL REQUIREMENT:
This conversation memory system is designed for PERSISTENT MCP SERVER PROCESSES.
It uses in-memory storage that persists only within a single Python process.

⚠️  IMPORTANT: This system will NOT work correctly if MCP tool calls are made
    as separate subprocess invocations (each subprocess starts with empty memory).

    WORKING SCENARIO: Claude Desktop with persistent MCP server process
    FAILING SCENARIO: Simulator tests calling server.py as individual subprocesses

    Root cause of test failures: Each subprocess call loses the conversation
    state from previous calls because memory is process-specific, not shared
    across subprocess boundaries.

ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW:
The MCP protocol is inherently stateless - each tool request is independent
with no memory of previous interactions. This module bridges that gap by:

1. Creating persistent conversation threads with unique UUIDs
2. Storing complete conversation context (turns, files, metadata) in memory
3. Reconstructing conversation history when tools are called with continuation_id
4. Supporting cross-tool continuation - seamlessly switch between different tools
   while maintaining full conversation context and file references

CROSS-TOOL CONTINUATION:
A conversation started with one tool (e.g., 'analyze') can be continued with
any other tool (e.g., 'codereview', 'debug', 'chat') using the same continuation_id.
The second tool will have access to:
- All previous conversation turns and responses
- File context from previous tools (preserved in conversation history)
- Original thread metadata and timing information
- Accumulated knowledge from the entire conversation

Key Features:
- UUID-based conversation thread identification with security validation
- Turn-by-turn conversation history storage with tool attribution
- Cross-tool continuation support - switch tools while preserving context
- File context preservation - files shared in earlier turns remain accessible
- NEWEST-FIRST FILE PRIORITIZATION - when the same file appears in multiple turns,
  references from newer turns take precedence over older ones. This ensures the
  most recent file context is preserved when token limits require exclusions.
- Automatic turn limiting (20 turns max) to prevent runaway conversations
- Context reconstruction for stateless request continuity
- In-memory persistence with automatic expiration (3 hour TTL)
- Thread-safe operations for concurrent access
- Graceful degradation when storage is unavailable

DUAL PRIORITIZATION STRATEGY (Files & Conversations):
The conversation memory system implements sophisticated prioritization for both files and
conversation turns, using a consistent "newest-first" approach during collection but
presenting information in the optimal format for LLM consumption:

FILE PRIORITIZATION (Newest-First Throughout):
1. When collecting files across conversation turns, the system walks BACKWARDS through
   turns (newest to oldest) and builds a unique file list
2. If the same file path appears in multiple turns, only the reference from the
   NEWEST turn is kept in the final list
3. This "newest-first" ordering is preserved throughout the entire pipeline:
   - get_conversation_file_list() establishes the order
   - build_conversation_history() maintains it during token budgeting
   - When token limits are hit, OLDER files are excluded first
4. This strategy works across conversation chains - files from newer turns in ANY
   thread take precedence over files from older turns in ANY thread

CONVERSATION TURN PRIORITIZATION (Newest-First Collection, Chronological Presentation):
1. COLLECTION PHASE: Processes turns newest-to-oldest to prioritize recent context
   - When token budget is tight, OLDER turns are excluded first
   - Ensures most contextually relevant recent exchanges are preserved
2. PRESENTATION PHASE: Reverses collected turns to chronological order (oldest-first)
   - LLM sees natural conversation flow: "Turn 1 → Turn 2 → Turn 3..."
   - Maintains proper sequential understanding while preserving recency prioritization

This dual approach ensures optimal context preservation (newest-first) with natural
conversation flow (chronological) for maximum LLM comprehension and relevance.

USAGE EXAMPLE:
1. Tool A creates thread: create_thread("analyze", request_data) → returns UUID
2. Tool A adds response: add_turn(UUID, "assistant", response, files=[...], tool_name="analyze")
3. Tool B continues thread: get_thread(UUID) → retrieves full context
4. Tool B sees conversation history via build_conversation_history()
5. Tool B adds its response: add_turn(UUID, "assistant", response, tool_name="codereview")

DUAL STRATEGY EXAMPLE:
Conversation has 5 turns, token budget allows only 3 turns:

Collection Phase (Newest-First Priority):
- Evaluates: Turn 5 → Turn 4 → Turn 3 → Turn 2 → Turn 1
- Includes: Turn 5, Turn 4, Turn 3 (newest 3 fit in budget)
- Excludes: Turn 2, Turn 1 (oldest, dropped due to token limits)

Presentation Phase (Chronological Order):
- LLM sees: "--- Turn 3 (Claude) ---", "--- Turn 4 (Gemini) ---", "--- Turn 5 (Claude) ---"
- Natural conversation flow maintained despite prioritizing recent context

This enables true AI-to-AI collaboration across the entire tool ecosystem with optimal
context preservation and natural conversation understanding.

def build_conversation_history(context: ThreadContext, model_context=None, read_files_func=None) -> tuple[str, int]:
    """
    Build formatted conversation history for tool prompts with embedded file contents.

    Creates a comprehensive conversation history that includes both conversation turns and
    file contents, with intelligent prioritization to maximize relevant context within
    token limits. This function enables stateless tools to access complete conversation
    context from previous interactions, including cross-tool continuations.

    FILE PRIORITIZATION BEHAVIOR:
    Files from newer conversation turns are prioritized over files from older turns.
    When the same file appears in multiple turns, the reference from the NEWEST turn
    takes precedence. This ensures the most recent file context is preserved when
    token limits require file exclusions.

    CONVERSATION CHAIN HANDLING:
    If the thread has a parent_thread_id, this function traverses the entire chain
    to include complete conversation history across multiple linked threads. File
    prioritization works across the entire chain, not just the current thread.

    CONVERSATION TURN ORDERING STRATEGY:
    The function employs a sophisticated two-phase approach for optimal token utilization:

    PHASE 1 - COLLECTION (Newest-First for Token Budget):
    - Processes conversation turns in REVERSE chronological order (newest to oldest)
    - Prioritizes recent turns within token constraints
    - If token budget is exceeded, OLDER turns are excluded first
    - Ensures the most contextually relevant recent exchanges are preserved

    PHASE 2 - PRESENTATION (Chronological for LLM Understanding):
    - Reverses the collected turns back to chronological order (oldest to newest)
    - Presents conversation flow naturally for LLM comprehension
    - Maintains "--- Turn 1, Turn 2, Turn 3..." sequential numbering
    - Enables LLM to follow conversation progression logically

    This approach balances recency prioritization with natural conversation flow.

    TOKEN MANAGEMENT:
    - Uses model-specific token allocation (file_tokens + history_tokens)
    - Files are embedded ONCE at the start to prevent duplication
    - Turn collection prioritizes newest-first, presentation shows chronologically
    - Stops adding turns when token budget would be exceeded
    - Gracefully handles token limits with informative notes

    Args:
        context: ThreadContext containing the conversation to format
        model_context: ModelContext for token allocation (optional, uses DEFAULT_MODEL fallback)
        read_files_func: Optional function to read files (primarily for testing)

    Returns:
        tuple[str, int]: (formatted_conversation_history, total_tokens_used)
        Returns ("", 0) if no conversation turns exist in the context

    Output Format:
        === CONVERSATION HISTORY (CONTINUATION) ===
        Thread: <thread_id>
        Tool: <original_tool_name>
        Turn <current>/<max_allowed>
        You are continuing this conversation thread from where it left off.

        === FILES REFERENCED IN THIS CONVERSATION ===
        The following files have been shared and analyzed during our conversation.
        [NOTE: X files omitted due to size constraints]
        Refer to these when analyzing the context and requests below:

        <embedded_file_contents_with_line_numbers>

        === END REFERENCED FILES ===

        Previous conversation turns:

        --- Turn 1 (Claude) ---
        Files used in this turn: file1.py, file2.py

        <turn_content>

        --- Turn 2 (Gemini using analyze via google/gemini-2.5-flash) ---
        Files used in this turn: file3.py

        <turn_content>

        === END CONVERSATION HISTORY ===

        IMPORTANT: You are continuing an existing conversation thread...
        This is turn X of the conversation - use the conversation history above...

    Cross-Tool Collaboration:
        This formatted history allows any tool to "see" both conversation context AND
        file contents from previous tools, enabling seamless handoffs between analyze,
        codereview, debug, chat, and other tools while maintaining complete context.

    Performance Characteristics:
        - O(n) file collection with newest-first prioritization
        - Intelligent token budgeting prevents context window overflow
        - In-memory persistence with automatic TTL management
        - Graceful degradation when files are inaccessible or too large
